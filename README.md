# cyclability

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cyclability is to generate estimates of broadly defined
cyclability. There are at least three definitions of how conducive to
cycling different places and segments of roads and travel networks are:

- [Level of Traffic Stress](https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress) (LTS)
- [Bikeability](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/cycletraining/article/ct20110111-cycletraining-What-is-Bikeability-0)
  levels, which rates infrastructure based on the level of training
  needed to feel comfortable:
  - Level 1 teaches basic bike-handling skills in a controlled
    traffic-free environment.
  - Level 2 teaches trainees to cycle planned routes on minor roads,
    offering a real cycling experience.
  - Level 3 ensures trainees are able to manage a variety of traffic
    conditions and is delivered on busier roads with advanced features
    and layouts
- CycleStreetsâ€™s [Quietness
  rating](https://www.cyclestreets.net/help/journey/howitworks/#quietness)
  from 1 (very unpleasant for cycling) to 100 (the quietest)
